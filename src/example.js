function foo() {
  return this;
}

// A regular function's "this" is always Window or undefined. It's undefined
// inside of a module file and it's Window in a plain browser script.
foo(); // Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}
window.foo(); // Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}

// You can create a new function from existing function where it's `this`
// is permanently set to whatever value you want. This does not mutate the
// original function.

// Example:
// `baz` is a new function that's copy of `foo` its `this` is
// set to 1.
baz = foo.bind(1);

baz(); // Number {1}

// `foo` is unchanged after the lines above.
foo(); // Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}

// `bar` is a copy of `foo` where its `this` is set to an array.
bar = foo.bind([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
bar(); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

// You can not re-bind a function that is already a bound version
// of another function.
boo = bar.bind("BOO!");

// `boo` is still using `this` from `bar` above.
boo()(6)[(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)];

// A regular function that is bound essentially behaves like
// arrow function. Like a bound function, an arrow function
// can never re-bind its `this`.

const myArrow = () => this;
const myFunc = function() {
  return this;
}.bind(this);
